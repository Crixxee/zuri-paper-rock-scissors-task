#paper rock scissors project
This is a game, One can play with the computer as the second user continuously till you quit. In this game, either of the user, will choose either R for rock, P for paper or S for scissors. Where paper covers rock, rock breaks scissors or scissors cuts paper. The user's choice determines who wins or if it's a draw. This is for fun/entrainment.
